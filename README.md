# Rails CRUD Practice

This MakerSquare exercise was an introduction to Rails. Previously we had learned how to create just Ruby apps and used the terminal client
or Sinatra to run them. In this exercise, we learned about rails and practiced Creating, Reading, Updating, and Destroying entities such as "Users", "Videos" (from YouTube) and "Sounds" (from SoundCloud). Also, we continued to expand on how ActiveRecord works with Rails to persist these entities to the database, and learned about "routes" and their resources.
